There is a cpp file, three hpp file, and Makefile.

Firstly, Assign2_20210236.cpp file is a main file that we compile mainly.

And next, there's student.hpp file , this contains two part: private part , public part. In private part, I declared student information variable. 
And in public part, I declared the object "student" there, and getter functions.

There's node.hpp file, by considering Linked list, there's "data" with loading student information, and the pointer which is pointing next node.

The third hpp file, list.hpp file, which is including the most important class, list class exists. There are lots of functions I made for utilise in main
function, and it contains all the thing about linked list.
